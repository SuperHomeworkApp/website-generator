By agreeing to the Fine Print, you give the developer, the SuperHomework services, and any affiliates permission to use your information as defined by this section.

The developer, the SuperHomework services, and any affiliates are in no way responsible for content you store in any SuperHomework service.

When you store content (including but not limited to the creation of new assignments, customization of settings, or subscription to a blog feed) in SuperHomework:

- It is viewable and modifiable by the developer and the SuperHomework services.
- It is viewable and modifiable by affiliates as defined by their Privacy Policies.
- It is stored under a randomly-generated ID using an anonymous account that does not contain personally-identifiable information, unless if you add personally-identifiable information into content you create. The developer, the SuperHomework services, and any affiliates are not responsible for any personally-identifiable information you add to content you create.

If you are a school administrator, when you register a school with SuperHomework:

- All of the websites included in the submission and their authors also become legally bound to this Fine Print.
- Portions of your submission's information, including but not limited to your school's name and content stored within the websites included in the submission, may be uploaded to a server controlled by Google Firebase and viewable by all SuperHomework users.

Neither SuperHomework nor the developer have access to your original account password. When you log out of the integration, the access token and refresh token are deleted.
- The access token and refresh token are used by the SuperHomework services to provide assignments from the integration to you, and are not used for any other reason.
- The developer, the SuperHomework services, any any affiliates are not responsible for the accuracy, availability or reliability of any third-party integration.

Data collected from these analytics services may include basic device information (including but not limited to your device’s software version, model, and relative location), performance information, and information about your interactions with SuperHomework. This information is not personally identifiable and used in aggregate as defined by the third-party services’ Privacy Policies.
